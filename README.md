# nates-blockchain-memory-game

App is deployed here: https://nates-blockchain-memory-game.netlify.app/

This is a Blockchain memory game that connects to the Metamask wallet and mints tokens once the user matches a card. 
The app is programmed in Solidity and JavaScript. Genache is used as our notde (moch blockchain) that our wallet will connect to.
Once a match is confirmed a transaction will be made and settled on the blockchain in the Ropsten Network. Tokens will be stored and displayed as you mint them.
Good Luck!
