# nates-blockchain-memory-game

App is deployed here: https://nates-blockchain-memory-game.netlify.app/

This React app is a Blockchain memory game that connects to the Metamask wallet and mints tokens once the user matches a card. 
The contracts were written in Solidity and connected to the back-end through JavaScript. 
Genache is used as our local node (moch blockchain). Hardhat can easily be used as well. The point is to just have a local node to handle the transactions.
The game:
Once a match is confirmed a transaction will be made and settled on the blockchain on the blockchain. Tokens will be stored in your wallet as an asset and displayed at the bottom of the screen as you mint them.
Good Luck!
